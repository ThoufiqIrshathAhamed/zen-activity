1.difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2
  
  * HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1.
  * HTTP1.1 loads resources one after other.if one cannot be loaded it blocks other resources behind it.
    HTTP2 use single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data by spliting data into binary code and numbering each code.
  * HTTP1.1 serves only the client asks.
    HTTP2 serves also 'PUSH' content before client asks for it.
  * Both HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 compress message to make them smaller but HTTP2 additionaly uses HPACK(which eliminates HTTP header packs).
